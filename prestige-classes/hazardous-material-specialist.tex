Occasionally SGC teams encounter dangerous materials, hostile environments or alien biological or chemical weapons. When this happens, hazardous materials specialists decontaminate the team members, the area around the Stargate, vehicles, etc. These specialists are also called in to identify dangerous agents on other planets and, if possible, remove or neutralize them, making it safe for other SGC teams to explore. At times hazardous materials specialists are even called in to assist medical teams in treating alien races.
