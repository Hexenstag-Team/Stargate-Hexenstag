In case of emergencies, the SGC maintains a stable of operatives dedicated to black operations - a ''dirty tricks squad," so to speak. While these characters sometimes operate alone, they're just as frequently used to supplement the abilities of an SG mission team.

The most common (and the most feared)  of these operatives are snipers. Trained extensively in a variety of firearms, the sniper specializes in eliminating an opponent from great distances, often with no sign of his passing.

\textbf{Abilities:} Considering the sniper's reliance on stealth, Dexterity is without a doubt his most prized ability.
