The Prime is among the most trusted servants of a Goa'uld System Lord, a devoted warrior of his honor guard. A System Lord's First Prime controls his complement of Jaffa warriors, and acts both as a personal bodyguard and a General in battle.

Only a Jaffa who's proven himself both loyal and talented may occupy this position, but even Primes are not immune to feelings of doubt - Teal'c, one of the most cherished members of the SGC, is the former First Prime of Apophis and a perfect example of how even the most loyal followers can be convinced to abandon an evil cause.
