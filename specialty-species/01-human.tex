\specialtyentry {U.S. Air Force}
The Stargate Command is directly under the control of the United States Air force (USAF), and as a result the majority of its personnel come from this branch of the military and its subsidiary specialties. Most characters with this macro-specialty receive their training at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, or else they're recruited from a field particularly relevant to the Stargate Program, such as aerospace engineering astrophysics.

\textbf{Shared Special Talents:}
\begin{itemize*}
\item +2 Intelligence, -2 to any one ability.
\item The character may choose 2 cross-class skills to become class skills. He may choose one additional cross-class skill to become a class skill at 4th level and for every 4 character levels gained thereafter.
\end{itemize*}

\subspecialtyentry{Air Force Officer}
Air Force officers possess a degree of political pull that most other Air Force personnel are without, and the Air Force's jurisdiction over the Stargate Program offers several benefits as well. Air Force officers are the most common members (and in fact the most common leaders) of SG field teams. Both Colonel Jack O'Neill and Captain Samantha Carter are drawn from this specialty.

\textbf{Special Talents:}
\begin{itemize*}
\item Pilot is always a class skill for the character.
\item +1 Specialty bonus with Bureaucracy and Pilot checks. This bonus increases by an additional +1 at 4th level and for every 4 character levels gained thereafter.
\item Pay Grade: The character is paid as an officer.
\item Bonus Feat: Any style feat. The character must meet all the prerequisites for this feat before choosing it.
\end{itemize*}

\subspecialtyentry{Air Force Technician}
Air Force technicians are recruited into the SG program as the primary experts on both the Stargate and the astrophysics involved with its use. Air Force technicians also work with the SGC's scientists to study alien technology and are involved in the research and development in the new Tauri. spacecraft. The SGC relies heavily upon Air Force technicians when facing unexpected problems with the Stargate.

\textbf{Special Talents:}
\begin{itemize*}
\item +1 Specialty bonus with Knowledge and Electronics checks. This bonus increases by an additional +1 at 4th level and for every 4 character levels gained thereafter.

\textbf{Special Talents:}
\begin{itemize*}
\item +1 Specialty bonus with Reflex saves. This bonus increases by an additional +1 at 4th level and for every 4 character levels gained thereafter.

\end{itemize*}

\subspecialtyentry{Navy SEAL}
The U.S. Navy SEAL program evolved from the Navy's Underwater Demolitions Team as a means of efficiently deploying divers and underwater units into combat zones.They are emulated by similar groups all around the world, but no others have managed to duplicate their ferocious dedication and skill, and none of their counterparts can yet lay claim to the stars. Like other Naval personnel, SEALs are somewhat under-utilized within the SGC, but their talents are nonetheless appreciated when submerged explosions are the flavor of the day.

\textbf{Special Talents:}
\begin{itemize*}
\item +1 Specialty bonus with Demolitions and Move Silently checks. This bonus increases by an additional +1 at 4th level and for every 4 character levels gained thereafter.

\end{itemize*}

\specialtyentry{Astronaut/Cosmonaut}
At present, only two nations on Earth maintain full training facilities for space explorers: the United States, through NASA, and Russia, through the Russian Space Agency (RKA) and its companion Military Space Forces (VKS). Despite having a Space Command component, the US Air Force does not train its own astronauts - yet. The personnel demands of the SGC may change this in the coming years, however, as NASA's astronaut corps is largely unsuited to support SGC operations.

\textbf{Special Talents:}
\begin{itemize*}
\item +2 to any one ability, - 2 to any ability. This penalty may be applied to the same ability that receives the bonus, if desired.

\end{itemize*}

%%Special Note: At the GM's discretion, a near-human character from a modern or advanced society with an active space program may select this specialty in lieu of his default near-human specialty.

\specialtyentry{Civilian Specialist}
While most of the SGC is a strictly military operation, civillans are often recruited for their unique knowledge or experience - resources not bred into the rigid structure of most military branches. Civilians are added to SG teams only after passing triple-verified background screens and a series of intense interviews. Civilian specialtsts often are exceptionally talented in one or two narrow scientific or academic Fields, and rarely possess any true combat acumen.

\item +2 Intelligence, -2 Strength.
\item The character chooses any 2 Craft, Knowledge, or Profession skill focuses. These skill focuses are always considered class skills for the character.

\specialtyentry{Diplomatic Corp}
The Diplomatic Corps is one of two special SGC divisions that are specifically non-military in design, though some military personnel do belong to the unit. This organization is comprised of civilian liaisons and diplomats whose principal function is to maintain smooth negotiations with alien worlds.

\item Pay Grade: The character is paid as a specialist.
\item Bonus Feat: Persuasive. All prerequisites for this feat - including minimum skill ranks - are waived.
\end{itemize*}

\specialtyentry{Engineering Corp}
Like the Diplomatic Corps, this SGC division isn't intimately military in design or nature. The Engineering Corps handles the construction of off-world facilities such as the Alpha Site and coordinates mining and other planetary resource operations. Its members work to establish permanent and semi-permanent bases and command outposts within enemy territory, and have also been known to work.alongside civilian specialists to research alien technology.

\specialtyentry{Russian Unit}
As a part of the compromise that allowed the Stargate Program to continue following the destruction of the Cheyenne Mountain gate, a few Russian mission groups now operate alongside the SGC's established teams, reporting primarily to the Russian government. These troops travel to alien worlds and aid in planetary defense against the Goa'uld. Though tension remains between SGC and Russian team members who haven't forgotten the Cold War, these mismatched allies have thus far managed to work alongside one another without a serious altercation.
