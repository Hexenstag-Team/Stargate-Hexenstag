\specialtyentry{Primitive Near-Human}

\subspecialtyentry{Abydonians}
The residents of Abydos are descended from humans taken from Ancient Egypt to work in the naquadah mines of Ra. They have since been freed by the SGC and are now staunch allies of Earth.

\textbf{Special Talents:}
\begin{itemize*}
\item +2 Constitution, -2 Intelligence. Abydonians are much hardier than their Earth counterparts, but while not necessarily less intelligent, they lack the rudiments of education that all Earth humans take for granted.
\item +1 Species bonus with any skill check made in the following skills: Handle Animal, Survival.
\item Cultural Weaponry: At 1st level, the character does not gain the Weapon Group Proficiency Feats typically granted by his base class. Instead, he gains the Weapon Group Proficiency (Hurled) and Weapon Group Proficiency (Melee) feats.
\item Languages: Ancient Egyptian is the native language of the Abydonians.
\item Pay Grade: While working with the SGC, the character is paid as an enlisted soldier or specialist.
\item Primitive Society Bonus Feat: Abydonians automatically receive the Desert Training feat for free. All prerequisites for this feat - including minimum skill levels - are waived.
\end{itemize*}

\subspecialtyentry{Argosians}
The residents of Argos are descended from humans taken from Ancient Greece to be used as guinea pigs in one of Pelops' nanotechnology experiments.

\textbf{Special Talents:}
\begin{itemize*}
\item +2 Charisma, -2 Strength. While Argosians have an almost unnatural attractiveness, their all but carefree existence left them little need for physical exertion.
\item +2 species bonus with Disposition checks. This bonus increases by an additional +1 at 4th level and for every 4 character levels gained thereafter.
\item Evolutionary Advantage: Genetically Engineered (+2 to Constitution): Whether through cloning or DNA sequencing, some near-human cultures learn to tinker with the basic building blocks of human biology, mastering the art of genetic manipulation. A near-human character possessing this evolutionary advantage gains a +2 species bonus with one ability score of his choice, as befits his cultural concept.
\item Evolutionary Disadvantage: Shortened Lifespan (100 days) or Gene Pool Deficiency (-2 to Intelligence).\textsuperscript{*}

Shortened Lifespan: Some near-human cultures are either engineered to have short lives ("burning bright before winking out") or to develop shortened life spans as a result of their environment. For the purposes of determining aging effects, a near-human character possessing this evolutionary disadvantage is considered to be twice his current age, rounded up. Further, the character suffers a -1 species penalty with all Intelligence-based skill checks.

OR

Gene Pool Deficiency: ln particularly small near-human communities and those within whose collective gene pool something goes missing, a deficiency builds up that can cause natural weaknesses. A near-human character possessing this evolutionary disadvantage suffers a -2 species penalty to one ability of the GM's choice, per the near-human cultural concept.
\item Cultural Weaponry: At 1st level, the character does not gain the Weapon Group Proficiency Feats typically granted by his base class. Instead, he gains the Weapon Group Proficiency (Hurled) and Weapon Group Proficiency (Melee) feats.
\item Languages: Ancient Greek is the native language of the Argosians.
\item Pay Grade: While working with the SGC, the character is paid as an enlisted soldier or specialist.
\item Primitive Society Bonus Feat: The Look. All prerequisites for this feat - including minimum skill levels - are waived.
\end{itemize*}

\textsuperscript{*}Prior to SG-1's arrival on Argos, Argosians had the Shortened Lifespan Evolutionary Disadvantage. After the events of Brief Candle, they have the Gene Pool Deficiency Evolutionary Disadvantage.


\subspecialtyentry{Byrsa}
The residents of Byrsa are descended from humans taken from ancient Carthage. Though they are not directly ruled by any Goa'uld, they remain vulnerable to slaving raids and other attacks from the System Lords.

\textbf{Special Talents:}
\begin{itemize*}
\item Evolutionary Advantage: Skill Enhancement (Hide, Move Silently): For generations the Goa'uld have used Cartago as a favored source of new hosts. Having no way to directly fight them, the Byrsa developed the uncanny knack to almost fade from sight to avoid being taken. These techniques are taught from the time a Byrsa can walk, and are practiced daily.

One task or habit that becomes ingrained in a near-human's mind can sometimes turn into an advantage when involved in a mission away from his homeworld. A near-human character possessing this evolutionary advantage may choose one skill with which he's considered to possess the Unlocked Potential feat. This evolutionary advantage does not affect the number of times the character may typically choose the Unlocked Potential feat, nor the number of times it may be applied to the chosen skill.
\item Evolutionary Disadvantage: Vulnerability (Extreme Cold): The Byrsa descend from stock that developed in Earth's equatorial regions, and they have lived in similar environments since being relocated by the Goa'uld. Given Cartago's mild weather, they have almost no experience with genuine cold.

Some worlds force human life to evolve with certain vulnerabilities to conditions and elements that are common or semi-common on other worlds (such as Earth). The GM chooses one condition or element. After a character with this evolutionary disadvantage is directly exposed to the chosen condition or element for 1 full round, he suffers 1d6 normal damage at the end of each round during which the exposure continues. The damage ceases when the character escapes direct exposure.

Further, a character with this evolutionary disadvantage suffers an additional 1d6 normal damage per successful attack with a weapon made of or at least 50% comprised of a chosen element.

Finally, if a character with this evolutionary disadvantage ingests 1 or more ounces of a chosen element, he is attacked with a poison having a Fort DC of 15, an onset time of 1 round, a primary damage value of 1d6 Con, and a secondary damage value of 2d6 Con.
\item Cultural Weaponry: At 1st level, the character does not gain the Weapon Group Proficiency Feats typically granted by his base class. Instead, he gains the Weapon Group Proficiency (Hurled) and Weapon Group Proficiency (Melee) feats.
\item Languages: Ancient Phoenician is the native language of the Byrsa.
\item Pay Grade: While working with the SGC, the character is paid as an enlisted soldier or specialist.
\item Primitive Society Bonus Feat: All Byrsa receive the Forest Training Feat. All prerequisites for this feat - including minimum skill levels - are waived.
\end{itemize*}

\subspecialtyentry{Ceradorisns}
The residents of Cerador are descended from Hindu stock and currently under the dominion of the goddess Kali.

\textbf{Special Talents:}
\begin{itemize*}
\item +2 Constitution, -2 Intelligence.
\item +1 Species Bonus with any skill check made in the following skills: Climb, Handle Animal. This bonus increases by an additional +1 at 4th level and every 4 character levels thereafter.
\item Evolutionary Advantage: Environmental Resistance (Heat): Some near-humans possess the ability to function in environments of extreme radiation, cold, heat, and other conditions. A near-human character possessing this evolutionary advantage gains a +2 species bonus with Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of one chosen environment. This bonus increases by +1 at 2nd level and for every 2 character levels gained thereafter.
\item Evolutionary Disadvantage: Awe: Many near-humans live directly under the dominion of the Goa'uld for most of their lives, instilling them with a sense of awe for their "gods." All Charisma-based skill checks made by a character with the Symbiote feat that target a character with Awe gain a +4 circumstance bonus.
\item Cultural Weaponry: At 1st level, the character does not gain the Weapon Group Proficiency Feats typically granted by his base class. Instead, he gains the Weapon Group Proficiency (Hurled) and Weapon Group Proficiency (Melee) feats.
\item Languages: Ancient Dravidic is the native tongue of the Ceradorisns people.
\item Pay Grade: While working with the SGC, the character is paid as an enlisted soldier. Near-human characters are often paid in barter or trade rather than a salary.
\item Primitive Society Bonus Feat: Desert Training. All prerequisites for this feat - including minimum skill levels - are waived.
\end{itemize*}

\subspecialtyentry{Cimmerian}
The residents of Cimmeria are transplants from ancient Scandinavia, having been brought there by the Asgard.

\textbf{Special Talents:}
\begin{itemize*}
\item +2 Constitution, -2 Charisma. The Cimmerians are a tough, hearty people, but their aggression and boisterousness can sometimes be unsettling to modern humans.
\item +1 Species bonus to all Balance and Survival skill checks. This bonus increases by an additional +1 at 4th level and for every 4 character levels gained thereafter.
\item Cultural Weaponry: At 1st level the character does not gain the Weapon Group Proficiency feats typically granted by his base class. Instead, he gains the Weapon Group Proficiency (Hurled) and Weapon Group Proficiency (Melee) feats.
\item Languages: Old Norse/Old Nordic is the native language of the Cimmerians.
\item Pay Grade: While working with the SGC, the character is paid as an enlisted soldier.
\item Primitive Society Bonus Feat: Cimmerians automatically receive the Forest Training feat for free. All prerequisites for this feat are waived.
\end{itemize*}

\subspecialtyentry{Denderrans}
The residents of Dendera are descended from Egyptian stock taken by Ra to serve in his Goa'uld breeding ground. They have since overthrown their god and now struggle to survive in their harsh environment.

\textbf{Special Talents:}
\begin{itemize*}
\item +2 Constitution, -2 Intelligence. Like many primitive societies, Denderrans are much hardier than modern humans, but lack our advances in education and technology.
\item +1 Species Bonus with any skill check made in the following skills: Climb, Survival. This bonus increases by an additional +1 at 4th level and every 4 character levels thereafter.
\item Evolutionary Advantage: Infestation Resistance:A near-human character possessing this evolutionary advantage has developed some means of resisting being taken as a host by a Goa'uld, either due to a particularly tough skin, bone fragments blocking the spine, or some other means of blocking the normal entrance path of the Goa'uld larva. Though this advantage does not guarantee safety, it does mean that the larva must find an alternative entrance into the body of its potential host. Whenever a Goa'uld larva attempts to take a near-human character with this advantage as a host, it takes three half actions instead of one: one to discover the advantage, one to search for a secondary means of entrance, and one to enter the host's body. 
\item Evolutionary Disadvantage: Gene Pool Deficiency (-2 to Charisma):  ln particularly small near-human communities and those within whose collective gene pool something goes missing, a deficiency builds up that can cause natural weaknesses. A near-human character possessing this evolutionary disadvantage suffers a -2 species penalty to one ability of the GM's choice, per the near-human cultural concept.
\item Cultural Weaponry: At 1st level, the character does not gain the Weapon Group Proficiency Feats typically granted by his base class. Instead, he gains the Weapon Group Proficiency (Hurled) and Weapon Group Proficiency (Melee) feats.
\item Languages: Ancient Egyptian is the native language of the Denderrans.
\item Pay Grade: While working with the SGC, the character is paid as an enlisted soldier. Near-human characters are often paid in barter or trade rather than a salary.
\item Primitive Society Bonus Feat: Swamp Training. Denderrans automatically receive the Swamp Training feat for free. All prerequisites for this feat- including minimum skill levels - are waived.
\end{itemize*}

\subspecialtyentry{Gallicians}
The residents of Gallicia are transplants from dark age Morocco, transplanted by the Goa’uld, who abandoned them for reasons unknown.

\textbf{Special Talents:}
\begin{itemize*}
\item +2 Constitution, -1 Charisma. The Gallicians as a whole are typically adaptable and subtle, but their suspicion of outsiders and strong theological beliefs can sometimes be off-putting to modern humans.
\item +1 Species bonus to all Balance and Survival skill checks. This bonus increases by an additional +1 at 4th level and for every 4 character levels gained thereafter.
\item Cultural Weaponry: At 1st level, the character does not gain the Weapon Group Proficiency Feats typically granted by his base class. Instead, he gains the Weapon Group Proficiency (Hurled) and Weapon Group Proficiency (Melee) feats.
\item Languages: A variant of Arabic is the most common trading tongue, with some regional offshoots for the various cultures from North Africa.
\item Pay Grade: While working with the SGC, the character is paid as an enlisted soldier.
\item Primitive Society Bonus Feat: Desert Training. All prerequisites for this feat are waived.
\end{itemize*}

\specialtyentry{Mature Primitive Near-Human}

\subspecialtyentry{Gemmondian}
The Gemmondians descend from the Aztecs, taken from Central and South America by the Goa'uld centuries ago.

\textbf{Special Talents:}
\begin{itemize*}
\item +2 Dexterity, -2 Intelligence. Gemmondians are adept craftsmen and very good with their hands, but their education system still lags behind modern humans.
\item +1 Species bonus to all Profession (any one pre-industrial) and Sense Motive skill checks. This bonus increases by an additional +1 at 4th level and for every 4 character levels gained thereafter.
\item Evolutionary Advantage - Thick Skin: Characters from this culture developed in
an environment where rugged living is a way of life. Adapting to the thick atmosphere and generations of life in harsh terrain, these near-humans are resistant to many forms of injury. Such characters gain a +2 natural armor bonus to their Defense. This bonus does not stack with the scout's armor bonus or similar bonuses.
\item Evolutionary Disadvantage - Shortened Lifespan: Some near-human cultures are either engineered to have short lives ("burning bright before winking out") or to develop shortened life spans as a result of their environment. For the purposes of determining aging effects, a near-human character possessing this evolutionary disadvantage is considered to be twice his current age, rounded up. Further, the character suffers a -1 species penalty with all Intelligence-based skill checks.
\item Cultural Weaponry: At 1st level, the character does not gain the Weapon Group Proficiency Feats typically granted by his base class. Instead, he gains the Weapon Group Proficiency (Hurled) and Weapon Group Proficiency (Melee) feats.
\item Languages: N'ahuatl (Aztec) is the native language of the Gemmondians.
\item Pay Grade: While working with the SGC, the character is paid as an enlisted soldier.
\item Primitive Society Bonus Feat: Ordinary Past. AlI prerequisites for this feat are waived.
